THOUGHTS ON THE ASSIGMENT

This assingment was pretty challenging, made worse by my missing the lecture. The power point of the lecture served as a compass, and the discussion board and other online sources filled in details like a map and waypoints.

I also referred to previous assignments from my pythons class to help refresh my understanding. I am learning that coding is more about knowing where to find what you are looking for than memorization. Collaboration is also key, as many eyes scouring resources for information is always better. However, decisions still has to be made about which solution you'd like to utilize.
